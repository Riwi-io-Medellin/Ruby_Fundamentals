### Exercises: Classes and Objects in Ruby

These exercises will help you understand how to define and use classes, create instance and class methods, and apply inheritance and mixins.

---

#### **Exercise 1: Defining a Class**
Create a class `Car` with attributes `make`, `model`, and `year`. Add a method `info` that returns a string containing the car's details.

```ruby
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 2: Instance Methods**
Add a method `start` to the `Car` class that prints "The car is starting!".

```ruby
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 3: Class Methods**
Add a class method `vehicle_type` to the `Car` class that returns "Automobile".

```ruby
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 4: Inheritance**
Create a class `ElectricCar` that inherits from `Car`. Add an attribute `battery_capacity` and a method `charge` that prints "Charging the battery!".

```ruby
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 5: Using Modules**
Create a module `Drivable` with a method `drive` that prints "Driving on the road!". Include this module in the `Car` class.

```ruby
# Your code here
```

---

#### **Exercise 6: Combining Everything**
Create an instance of `ElectricCar` and call all available methods (`info`, `start`, `drive`, and `charge`). Verify that inheritance and mixins work as expected.

```ruby
# Your code here
```
